# NoCloud
Cloud. Self-hosted. From the convenience of your own machine. Be in control of your infrastructure.

## Project Structure
main will be the place for the full working implementation of the entire platform when it's ready.
develop branch contains the current snapshot of the code snippets and prototypes that will be used.

Code in main branch will be released under MIT License when it's ready.
Code in develop branch will remain unlicensed (means all rights are reserved to me) until it's considered stable for use.

## WARNING
The code in develop is very untested and will screw up your system if you don't understand what they do. While the code is unlicensed, I will not pursue those that fork my project and take it down. Use the code at your own risk. Here be dragons!
