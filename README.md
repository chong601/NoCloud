# NoCloud

This is the development branch where code comes in here whenever they're _sorta_ lightly tested. Not for production use. I am not responsible for what it does on your system. You have been warned.

Expect expelatives in the comments/commits because hey, that's really how I work. Deal with itâ„¢.

## WARNING
The code in develop is very untested and will screw up your system if you don't understand what they do. While the code is unlicensed, I will not pursue those that fork my project and take it down. Use the code at your own risk. Here be dragons!
